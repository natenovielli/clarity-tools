
# Welcome to the Clarity tools project!

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to share tools that build on top of the data collected by [clarity-js](https://github.com/Microsoft/clarity-js)

## Building Extension
 - Build everything: `npm run build`
 - Chrome Extension will now be built under: `build\extension-chrome`
 - Edge Extension will now be built under: `build\extension-edge`
 
## Privacy Notice
Clarity handles sensitive data with care. By default content on the page is masked before upload, so no actual text from the page is sent to the server.
All data collection is performed solely with the purpose of providing better insights into customers' pages interactions and improving their users' experiences.

## Current State
Tools project is still in active development. While it's not yet ready for production use, we continue making improvements and encourage the community to join us in the process!
